Cider-CI Ansible Setup
======================

This is an Ansible playbook to set up and maintain a complete
[Cider-CI](https://github.com/cider-ci/cider-ci) environment. This usually
means one _Cider-CI Server_ and a number of _Cider-CI Executors_.



Usage
-----

We use it like this:

    ansible-playbook -i hosts_zhdk play_site.yml

Create your own `hosts` file and use that one it in lieu of
`hosts_zhdk`.

This playbook contains a number of git submodules. Do not forget to [initialize
those](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). 


Supported Ansible Versions
--------------------------

This role was tested with Ansible => 1.8.x

Supported Operating Systems
---------------------------

Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty (recommended).
Debian 7 Wheezy (see notes below).

Debian Jessie will be supported in the future.


### Using Debian Wheezy


Cider-CI supports Debian Wheezy. There are a few gotchas and therefore it is
recommended to use Ubuntu 14.04 whenever possible.

Wheezy must be reconfigured to use `systemd`. This can be achieved by installing
`apt-get install systemd-sysv` and rebooting.

Wheezy also requires the backports repository. The Ansible setup will take care of
that.
